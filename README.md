# Unison UI

[Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/) tooling for VS Code.

## Features

### Codebase Sidebar

![A screenshot of VS Code with Unison terms showing in the sidebar.](resources/codebase-sidebar.png)

Browse codebase terms and types without leaving the comfort of your editor.

To view your codebase in the sidebar:

1. If you are connecting to your local codebase, ensure UCM is running via the `ucm` command
2. Open the Unison sidebar option
3. Click "Configure Codebase"
4. Enter in the URL of your UCM instance API root. This is the the same URL as the UCM UI but with `/ui` replaced with `/api` eg. http://127.0.0.1:59705/sUA6PIoIZJMFG3Wn4BrWwZ9HzZKySX4r/api
